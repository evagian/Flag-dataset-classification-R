# Flag-dataset-classification-R

Introduction
The data set contains details of various nations and their flags. In the first part of this project, we will try
predicting the religion of a country from its flag’s characteristics. In order to efficiently train the models
we will need to transform the data set into proper form and we will also need to reduce the number of
attributes which will be used as input in the models. It is crucial that we accurately specify, which
characteristics of a flag are correlated to a country’s religion and therefore we might be able to predict it.
In the second part of the project clustering methods will be used to find clusters of flags with respect to
their characteristics. We will then discover the common characteristics of the countries within each
cluster. We hope that there will be a connection between the clusters and the religions of the within
countries.

Dataset
The dataset consists of 30 variables, 10 of them are numeric and the rest of them are either Boolean or
nominal. Figure 1 describes the names and the values of each variable.
